# Coors-Field-Baseball-Simulation

This was a fluid dynamics project to show how elevation and the humiodr at coors field effects the projectile of a baseball.  The simulation assumes that the conditions are almost perfect in all three subplots.  Each subplot takes into account lift of the baseball, drag of the baseball, air density, gravity and size of a baseball when it is dry up and when it is not.
